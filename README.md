# CashScript Playground
The CashScript Playground is an online IDE for writing CashScript smart contracts and immediately interact with them in the browser. The playground the easiest way to quickly get started with CashScript without any setup. The CashScript playground is inspired by Ethereum's Remix.

The CashScript Playground is available at [playground.cashscript.org](https://playground.cashscript.org/).

In the left panel you can write CashScript contracts and compile them. After compiling, a contract Artifact is generated which can then be used to initialise an instance of the contract, with specific contract arguments.

## Limitations
Special transaction options such as OP_RETURN, hardcoded fees or relative timelocks are not supported by the playground.

The playground also does not support the combining multiple different smart contracts in one transaction.

## Disclaimer

The CashScript-Playground is connected to the Bitcoin Cash chipnet by default, you can get testnet coins from the [testnet faucet](https://tbch.googol.cash/). You can also connect the playground to mainnet but be sure **never to send large amounts** of money to contracts or wallets generated by the CashScript Playground!
